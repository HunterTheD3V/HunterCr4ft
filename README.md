### History
Who am i?
My name is HunterCr4ft, but i go as Hunter.
I started my programming career back in 2012, when i thought on making my first game using Flash.

In that time i was only 8 years old, Yeah, that's right. on that time, what inspired me was my father. my father is Senior Developer that have 21 years of experience as a programmer, and is going to make it's 22 years birthday soon.
since early 00s, my father used to work on websites, and stuff. i used to like his work and he kept saying to me:
"yeah son, i know school sucks, but if you want to be a dev, you must study hard for it. in reality, you can be a programmer whenever you want, your creativity is the limit and your age/size or obstacles don't and never will stop you"

So i started studying basic Web development on 2012 and on 2013, i released my first game in flash called "Bonkers", which wasn't a well-made game, but i didn't stop there. on 2015, i released another game called "Eternal Rivals: FSW", which was a success in that time. the game itself was coded with Flash actionscript and Typescript. the project was a small success in that time, with at least 2k plays, which was a success compared to my first game i released, with 353 plays only. Later that time passed, making updates was starting to get harder and harder (and more stressful). due to the fact flash wasn't a optimization pro, and the fact the whole code was a mess. seriously, i rewrote a single file 13 times because flash wasn't booting the file. Later on 2017, i got noticed my Adobe to migrate from flash when they announced flash discontinuation, and i didn't migrate, but surely on 2018 i deleted the game together with my newgrounds account, since the project was dying, inactive playerbase, hard to maintain and a bunch of other IRL things that started to turn it into a big massive snowball. from that, i slowly started to change....
After 2018, i decided to skip 2019 completely (in terms of development and new projects) and jumped to 2020. which started my new discord developer career.

 then i started again a new project on May 25 called discraft and here, my folks, is where [HyMiner](https://github.com/NickHunterD3V/HyMiner) story starts. but after that, i migrated to AOI 2 months later and paebukoa decided to join the project, being the first known project made by both of us. as the time passed, paebukoa was getting used to aoi.js and , since aoi was heavily modified for hyminer, he decided to make a library for HyMiner called APO.js . this idea, evolved, and turned into something called Hytescript.js, which is a big project ngl. i told paebukoa i won't work in the project as I'm weak on discord.js, so i never were a real Hytescript dev, and neither will be. it ain't my focus for now. 

on 2021 i also started to study C#, Python, Java and C++ because i had a plan to remake Eternal Rivals with Unity and make it the first release of HyTera Ultra Studios as the HyTera Development team is the current active.
on 2022, Things started to evolve, like the development of HyteScript, HyMiner v3 development and the failure of a Bot "franchise" that i don't want to say here. nowadays I'm called "lazy developer" because i barely can do anything in my free time as I'm surrounded by school, Courses and life tasks. meanwhile, paebukoa barely can do anything anymore as he is also focusing on Courses to improve his knowledge and take a step ahead.
